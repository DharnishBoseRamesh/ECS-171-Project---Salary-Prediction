# ECS-171-Project---Salary-Prediction

## Description
Our project is about building a machine learning model to predict salaries based on factors such as job title, years of experience, education, cost of living, location, and many more features. The goal is to create a reliable model that can provide salary estimates for different job positions. We will use a publicly available dataset (most likely from Kaggle) containing job data with the features listed above. Our approach will be testing different regression models such as linear regression, polynomial regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression and other methods as well. This project is significant because it will help job seekers and employers understand compensation trends and set expectations. The results will include model performance metrics, feature importance analysis, a comparison of different models, and salary predictions for new data based on job title, experience, and other factors.
